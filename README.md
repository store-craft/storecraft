  // ... MORE Mandatory CONFIG
})
.withPlatform(new NodePlatform())
.withDatabase(new LibSQL())
.withStorage(new NodeLocalStorage('storage'))
.withMailer(new Resend())
.withPaymentGateways({
  paypal: new Paypal({ env: 'test' }),
  stripe: new Stripe(),
  dummy_payments: new DummyPayments(),
})
.withExtensions({
  postman: new PostmanExtension(),
})
.withAI(
  new OpenAI({ model: 'gpt-4o-mini'})
)
.withVectorStore(
  new LibSQLVectorStore({
    embedder: new OpenAIEmbedder(),
  })
)
.withAuthProviders({
  google: new GoogleAuth(),
})
.on(
  'order/checkout/complete',
  async (event) => {
    // send a team slack message
  }
).init();

await migrateToLatest(app._.db, false);
await app._.vector_store?.createVectorIndex();

http
.createServer(app.handler)

### Examples Playground

### Releasing

The source of truth for the versioning and publishing is the mono-repo version.
All the published packages are synced to the mono-repo version. Packages in
the mono-repo source code might have different versions but it doesn't matter
for the published packages.

#### Versioning

All versions are synced to the mono-repo version, and are published to npm.
Each of the commands:

```bash
npm run release:version:patch
npm run release:version:minor
npm run release:version:major
```

Will,

- Only update the version of the mono-repo.
- Add a git tag of the version.

#### Publishing

When running the command: 

```bash
npm run release:publish
```

It will,

- Update the version of all the packages in the mono-repo to the same version as the mono-repo.
- Publish all the packages to `npm` with the same version as the mono-repo.

> This can be done in a CI/CD pipeline, or manually.
