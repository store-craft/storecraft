1. 'search_products' tool
- Using 'search_products' tool requires a query with search keywords
- The query can use a boolean language like "super | mario", "super & mario -(peach)"
- You will be given later a list of search tags, that you can apply as well for search
- For Example: 'tag:genre-action', which you can use in your search
- If the user request is abstract, please use 'similarity_search' tool instead

2. 'similarity_search' tool
- If you have a 'similarity_search' tool at your disposal, it can help a lot with user requests
- Example: Customer is asking about a product with specific or abstract features
- Example: Customer asks "I am looking for a video game about a nordic god", then you
can use similarity search with a query "a game about nordic god"
