# Products Collections

Products by their own are nice, but we usually would like to have them
as part of a collection of products with similar properties.
For example:
- ðŸ‘• A group of shirts.
- ðŸ©³ A group of pants.
- ðŸ’¸ A group of of products with a discount.

You get the idea, this is how we are used to shop. Similar products are grouped
together so they can be easily found.

Fortunately, `shelf` support a concept called `collections`. 

Collections are containers that of products. Given a product in `shelf`,
you can tell `shelf`, that the product belongs to a collection.

Each product can belong to **multiple** collections. So, as an example,
A Honda car can belong to `cars` collection, but also to a `honda` collection.

Users will be able to pull collections by their **handle**. A handle is like a 
unique id, but has another benefit - it is human readable.

For example, a collection of SUV Cars can simply have a handle `suv-cars`, which
is readable, human readable. We make sure, that a handle can only be created once,
giving it the property of uniqueness as well.

You probably want to know how does the connection between a product and a collection
happens. Well, it is quite simple:
- Every `product` has a `collections` property, which is just a list of collections handles, that
the product belong to.
- In addition, upon product update at shelf, every product's [search](schema/definitions#ProductData) property is augmented
with `col:<COLLECTION-HANDLE>`
- Both of this help with retrival, indexing and querying of products in collections.

## Exporting Collections
But, it might be costly to query products of a collection every time in **Firestore**,
therefore, the recommended way is to export a collection (`publish` operation in `shelf`).

Every time you add products to a collection, you can feel free to publish again.

When a collection is published at `shelf`
- The database is queried to find all of the products, that belong to this collection.
- The products list is merged into a collection object.
- The object is serialized into `JSON`, then compressed with `gzip`
- The compressed file is uploaded into your firebase storage
- the collection's `_published` property links to the url of the file

retrieving a file from object storage has many benefits:
1. It is cheaper than querying the **firestore** database
2. The file itself is compressed and is very small even for **1k** products and more
3. It is cached on the client for 60 minutes, which makes a nice balance between cache hit and miss
4. Given that you download all the products in the collection, then you can easily create the fastest
client side product filtering. As opposed to backend side filtering

Using this method can yield great results. It is fast, cost-effective and many times is
the right thing to do.

## How Do I add products to collections ?
There are three ways to do so

Inside each product page, there is a `collections` card

### From a collection page
Inside each collection page, there is a `Products in collection` card
