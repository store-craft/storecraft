# Checkouts

`Checkouts` are basucally `draft` orders initiated from the client side.

They have two phases:

## Checkout creation
1. User at your store fills a cart.
2. He navigates to checkout page
3. Customer selects shipping method
3. Customer optionally specifies `coupons`
4. A checkout is created at backend:
  * `draft` order is created
  * `Validation` of order against available stock
  * `Pricing` is calculated with discounts, coupons and shipping
  * `Payment Gateway` creates a payment **intent**
  * All of this is recorded in [#OrderData](schema/defintions#OrderData) object
5. A checkout object (`OrderData`) is returned to the client
6. The result is displayed to the user, such as discounts and total pricing

## Checkout completion
7. customer sees the payment form. 
8. Fills his payment method and `CONFIRMS` payment. 

Payment can initiate two behaviours

#### synchronously (at your backend)

Where you try to confirm the `authorization` / `capture` with possibly some payload
from the frontend. This is eager mode. It has pros and cons.

#### asynchronously (at the payment processor servers)

In this mode, payments are confirmed at `PayPal` or `Stripe` servers, they also
usually handle **3DS** security automatically at frontend.

Afterwards, you are notified via `webhooks` about the status of the payment.
Then you need to confirm the webhook is valid and was sent from a trusted source.
If this is the case, you can proceed to change the checkout and payment status of
[#OrderData](schema/defintions#OrderData).

> Our backend, currently emphesizes **synchronous** payments, but you can modify this easily


# Rest API
Your `shelf` client communicates **checkout** with your backend via restful **API**.

## <Purple c='Checkout' /> create

<Purple c='POST'/> request for <Lime c='/checkouts/create'/>
```
<BACKEND-HOST>/checkouts/create
```

### <Purple c='Request BODY' className='text-xl mt-5' />
A **JSON** body of partial [#OrderData](schema/defintions#OrderData), that
contains 
- Optional `order` id
- `line_items`
- `delivery`, which is [#ShippingData](schema/defintions#ShippingData)
- `payment_gateway` : `{ gateway_id: 'paypal-standard-payments' }`

### <Purple c='Return' className='text-xl mt-5' />
A **JSON** body of complete [#OrderData](schema/defintions#OrderData), that
contains 
- `order` id
- correct [line_items](schema/defintions#LineItem)
- `pricing`,  a complete [#PricingData](schema/defintions#PricingData)
- `payment_gateway` : `{ on_checkout_create: object }` - The result of `onCheckoutCreate` hook
- `validations`, which is a list [#ValidationEntry](schema/defintions#ValidationEntry)
- or general `{ error }` object


## <Purple c='Checkout' /> complete

<Purple c='POST'/> request for <Lime c='/checkouts/{order-id}/complete'/>
```
<BACKEND-HOST>/checkouts/{ORDER-ID}/complete
```

### <Purple c='Request BODY' className='text-xl mt-5' />
Any object, that will get passed to your gateway `onCheckoutComplete` hook.
Usually, for passing information about `payment method` in **synchronous** confirmation.


### <Purple c='Return' className='text-xl mt-5' />
A JSON body of complete [#OrderData](schema/defintions#OrderData), that
also contains 
- `payment_gateway` : `{ on_checkout_complete: object }` - The result of `onCheckoutComplete` hook
