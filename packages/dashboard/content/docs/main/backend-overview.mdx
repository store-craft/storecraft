We do recommend visiting our open source backend proposal. It is light weight
(160 **kb**) and has enought features to get you started.

#### 5. And <Purple c='security'/>

Each `shelf-admin` call to your backend for `payments` (status / void / capture / refund),
is sent with

- `JWT` signed with a secret known to you only (<Purple c='Coming soon !'/>)

You can use any of any of these to decide to process the requests coming from `shelf-admin`.
