# Security

`shelf` sends **http** requests with two security measures always.
You can choose which one to respond to

### apiKey
`apiKey` security is easy to get started with, but it fragile.
Support it with caution.

Each <Purple c='payment' /> is sent with `apiKey` query param.
You generate `apiKey` at `shelf-admin > settings`

<Image src='/docs/main/backend-sec-1.webp' className='w-full sm:w-1/2 mx-auto mt-5' />

Don't forget to hit the <Purple c='save'/> button afterwards.

When a request is made to the backend, we put `apiKey` at the query parameters
of the request.

> This is a fragile security practice. Keys might be sniffed by a middle proxy.

When your backend recieves the request it can compare the `apiKey` to validate
the request.

### JWT (JSON Web Token)
Each request is augmented with <Lime c='Header' />

```js
{
  Authorization: BEARER <JWT>
}
```

The JWT is signed with a secret (generated at `shelf-admin > settings`) with

#### Header
```json
{
  "alg": "HS256",
  "typ": "JWT"
}
```

#### payload

```json
{
  "sub": "shelf-admin",
  "iat": 1516239022
}
```

#### signature
```json
HMACSHA256(
  base64UrlEncode(header) + "." +
  base64UrlEncode(payload), 
  <your-256-bit-secret>
) 
```

You will verify the signature of the payload and decide if to accept the request
based on time window for example (requests that are no more than 30 seconds old).

This security model is better than `apiKey` model.
