# Collections

`shelf` manages your **firestore** to create the a fully functional commerce platform.
It does so by managing the following collections:

## Reference

* `/products` collection to store product information
* `/collections` collection to store collections information
* `/storefronts` collection to manage storefront data
* `/tags` collection to manage laconic key value tags (helpful for filtering)
* `/users` collection to manage users
* `/discounts` collection to manage automatic and manual(coupons) discounts
* `/orders` collection to manage orders with states and line items
* `/shipping_methods` collection to manage shipping methods
* `/images` collection to manage images
* `/payment_gateways` collection to manage configurations of **payment gateways**
* `/posts` collection to manage rich media
* `/notifications` collection to manage admin **notifications**
* `/settings` collection to manage admin **settings**
* `/bots` collection to manage admin **bots**

Once, `shelf` manages these collections for your project, you can use them in your app
however you want at client side and abckend side. But, we made things simpler for you,
we developed an optional client side **SDK** and a sample backend to enable payments and
checkouts from a website as well as emails.
