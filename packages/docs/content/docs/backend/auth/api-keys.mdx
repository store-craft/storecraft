# Api Keys

**Storecraft** **API** supports secured endpoints, via **API Keys**, given to third party servers.

> Authentication is usually used via the **REST API**, be sure to check the relevant docs

First,

```ts
const app = new App(config)
.withPlatform(new NodePlatform())
.withDatabase(new MongoDB())
.withStorage(new GoogleStorage())
.init();

```

## API Keys

**API** keys are typically issued for a 3rd party server or integration, that you trust and OWN.
Each API key will create a new Authenticated User with credentials (username and password),
embedded in the api key.

> In the future, we will add roles for API Keys, so you can issue a key with limited access to certain resources.

> A conveniant way to manage API Keys is in the Dashboard Settings Page

### Example Create APIKey

```ts
import type { ApiKeyResult } = '@storecraft/core/api';

const apikeyResult: ApiKeyResult = await app.api.auth.create_api_key();

apikeyResult.apikey
```

Will produce,

```json
{
  apikey: "YXVfNjY3OTRhNjBhN2NhMmQzZDdlNTZiZjRmQGFwaWtleS5zdG9yZWNyYWZ0LmFwaTpoUnNsMHFLcW1oQm0yQ0tKa0I1VTVnTnhnZElXcl95aWs3akI4amF6V0I3ckJ1YllyeEZRQ290QTh0QTRScEdWQkFLTzh5Um5HUHo3d0UtTDJGSTRQQQ"
}
```

If you `base64` decode the `apikey` and split by `:` character, you will get

```json
// {user ID}@{Email}
au_66794a60a7ca2d3d7e56bf4f@apikey.storecraft.api

// password
hRsl0qKqmhBm2CKJkB5U5gNxgdIWr_yik7jB8jazWB7rBubYrxFQCotA8tA4RpGVBAKO8yRnGPz7wE-L2FI4PA
```

> 3rd party services use this key with

Then, in http headers

```txt
X-API-KEY: YXVfNjY3OTRhNjBhN2NhMmQzZDdlNTZiZjRmQGFwaWtleS5zdG9yZWNyYWZ0LmFwaTpoUnNsMHFLcW1oQm0yQ0tKa0I1VTVnTnhnZElXcl95aWs3akI4amF6V0I3ckJ1YllyeEZRQ290QTh0QTRScEdWQkFLTzh5Um5HUHo3d0UtTDJGSTRQQQ
```
