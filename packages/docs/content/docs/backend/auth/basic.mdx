# Basic Auth

**Storecraft** **API** supports secured endpoints, via **Basic Auth**

> Authentication is usually used via the **REST API**, be sure to check the relevant docs

First,

```ts
const app = new App(config)
.withPlatform(new NodePlatform())
.withDatabase(new MongoDB())
.withStorage(new GoogleStorage())
.init();
```

## Basic Auth

Basic Auth is used for direct access to the API, via **email** and **password**.
This is useful for testing or debugging purposes, but is inefficient for production use,
because the backend will have to verify the credentials for each request against a hashed
password in the database.

### Example 

Each Basic Auth is a `base64` encoded string of the format `{email}:{password}`

```ts
const KEY = base64(`${email}:${password}`)
```

Then, in http headers


```txt
Authorization: Basic {KEY}
```
