# Checkouts

`Checkouts` represent a flow, where a customer tries to buy and hopefully succeeds.

First, le's assume an app,

```ts
import { App } from '@storecraft/core'
import type { CollectionType, AuthUserType } from '@storecraft/core/v-api'
import { UniformTaxes } from '@storecraft/core/v-taxes';

const app = new App(config)
.withPlatform(new NodePlatform())
.withDatabase(new MongoDB())
.withStorage(new GoogleStorage())
.withTaxes(new UniformTaxes(18))

await app.init();

```

> Don't forget to consult the REST API Checkout Documentation

They have two phases,

## Checkout Creation

- User at your store fills a Cart (**line-items**).
- He navigates to checkout page
- Customer selects **shipping method**
- Customer optionally specifies **Coupons** (Manual Discounts)
- Customer fills his **contact** info
- Customer optionally fills his **authentication id**
- A request is sent to the backend with all this data
- A `checkout` is created at backend:
  * `Draft` order is created
  * `Validation` of order against available stock
  * `Pricing` is calculated with discounts, coupons and shipping
  * `Payment Gateway` creates a payment **intent**
  * All of this is recorded in [#OrderData](schema/defintions#OrderData) object
- A checkout object (`OrderData`) is returned to the client
- The result is displayed to the user, such as discounts and total pricing

In Code of `storecraft`,  this will look like

```ts

const draft_order = await app.api.checkout.create_checkout(
  {
    line_items: [
      { id: products[0].handle, qty: 1 },
      { id: products[1].handle, qty: 1 },
    ],
    shipping_method: shipping,
    contact: {
      email: 'a1@a.com'
    }
  }, 'dummy_payments_processor_handle'
);


```

> Usually, you will just use the REST API for that

## Checkout completion
- Customer sees the payment details. 
- Fills his **payment method** and `CONFIRMS` payment. 

Payment can initiate two behaviours

### Synchronous Completion (at your backend)

Where you try to confirm the `authorization` / `capture` with possibly some payload
from the frontend. This is eager mode. It has pros and cons.

In code, 

```ts

await app.api.checkout.complete_checkout(order.id);

```

This will initiate,
- Payment Confirmation with the Payment Gateway's [`onCheckoutComplete`](/) hook
- Returns the complete and approved [OrderData]()

Synchronous payments and checkouts completion are prefered in many use cases.

### Asynchronous Completion (via webhook)

In this mode, 

- payments are confirmed at `PayPal` or `Stripe` or other provider servers, they also
usually handle **3DS** security automatically at frontend.
- You are notified via `webhooks` about the status of the payment at `/api/gateways/{gateway_handle}/webhook`
- Then you need to confirm the webhook is valid and was sent from a trusted source.
- If this is the case, the endpoint notifies:
  - The storecraft intrinsic order id
  - The storecraft order's Payment Status
  - The storecraft order's Checkout Status
