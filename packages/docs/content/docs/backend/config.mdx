# Configuration

Every storecraft app is instantiated with a configuration object, which helps the
developer to configure some aspects of the internal logic of the app's engine.

For example,

```ts
import { App } from '@storecraft/core';

new App(
  {
    auth_admins_emails: ['admin@mydomain.com'],
    auth_secret_access_token: process.env.auth_secret_access_token,
    ...
  }
)...

```

Also

## StorecraftConfig

Config object is called `StorecraftConfig`, with the following properties

```ts
import type { StorecraftConfig } from '@storecraft/core';
```

<SimpleTable column_names={['property', 'type']}
  rows={
    [
      ['dashboard_version', 'string'],
      ['auth_admins_emails', 'string[]'],
      ['auth_secret_access_token', 'string'],
      ['auth_secret_refresh_token', 'string'],
      ['auth_secret_confirm_email_token', 'string'],
      ['auth_secret_forgot_password_token', 'string'],
      ['checkout_reserve_stock_on', `'checkout_create' | 'checkout_complete' | 'never'`],
      ['storage_rewrite_urls', 'string'],
      ['general_store_name', `string`],
      ['general_store_website', `string`],
      ['general_store_logo_url', `string`],
      ['general_store_description', `string`],
      ['general_store_support_email', `string`],
      ['general_confirm_email_base_url', `string`],
      ['general_forgot_password_confirm_base_url', `string`],
      ['cors', `object`],
    ]
  }
  />


## Properties

### dashboard_version

The `storecraft` dashboard default version, if absent will default to 
the same version as the version of storecraft `core`. It is not recommended to
change this value unless you are sure of what you are doing.

### chat_version

The `storecraft` chat default version, if absent will default to 
the same version as the version of storecraft `core`. It is not recommended to
change this value unless you are sure of what you are doing.

### auth_admins_emails

Seed admin emails, if absent will be infered at init by `platform.env.SC_AUTH_ADMIN_EMAILS` environment as CSV of emails,
each admin's initial password is `admin` and it can be changed later (through dashboard/settings)


### auth_secret_access_token

Access token signing secret, if absent will be infered at init by `platform.env.SC_AUTH_SECRET_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment.

### auth_secret_refresh_token

Refresh token signing secret, if absent will be infered at init by `platform.env.SC_AUTH_SECRET_REFRESH_TOKEN` environment.

### auth_secret_forgot_password_token
  
Forgot password token signing secret, if absent will be infered at init by `platform.env.SC_AUTH_SECRET_FORGOT_PASSWORD_TOKEN` environment  

### auth_secret_confirm_email_token

confirm email token signing secret, if absent will be infered at init by `platform.env.SC_AUTH_SECRET_CONFIRM_EMAIL_TOKEN` environment  

### checkout_reserve_stock_on

(Optional) Automatically reserve stock on key events such as `checkout_create` | `checkout_complete` | `never`, we recommend to use `never`.
Depending on your needs you can alter this setting.
if absent will be infered at init by `platform.env.SC_CHECKOUT_RESERVE_STOCK_ON` 
environment and then will default to `never`.

**@default** never


### storage_rewrite_urls

(Optional) Once object `storage` is used, you may have connected a 
**CDN** to buckets to take advantage of faster assets serving instead of serving 
from your server / the storage service directly. If you are using an cloud based 
storage service such as AWS S3, it is very recommended to attach the bucket to 
a **CDN** for super fast and efficient serving.

Take note, most cloud based storage services and `storecraft` drivers support creating 
`presigned` urls for `download` / `upload`, which essentially delegate these operations
to the storage services. However, **CDN** is always the best choice for assets serving
cost and latency wise.

if absent will be infered at init by `platform.env.SC_STORAGE_REWRITE_URLS` environment.

**@default** undefined

### cors
(Optional) Your chance to override the default `CORS` config for HTTP requests

### general_store_name
(optional) The store name, also infered from `platform.env.SC_GENERAL_STORE_NAME` environment

### general_store_website

### general_store_description
The store `description`, also infered from `platform.env.SC_GENERAL_STORE_DESCRIPTION` environment

### general_store_support_email
The store support email `platform.env.SC_GENERAL_STORE_SUPPORT_EMAIL` environment

### general_confirm_email_base_url
The store `email-confirm` base url into which a template
action button will link into including a `token` as a query parameter.

#### For example:
Suppose the base url is `https://store.com/confirm`,
then `storecraft` default email template will use this to send
a link with `https://store.com/confirm?token={{CONFIRM_TOKEN}}`

You can use this to delegate into `storecraft` auth backend endpoint
`/api/auth/confirm-email?token={{CONFIRM_TOKEN}}`

**@default** `platform.env.SC_GENERAL_STORE_CONFIRM_EMAIL_BASE_URL` environment


### general_forgot_password_confirm_base_url

The store `forgot-password` base url, into which template action
button will link into including a `token` as a query parameter.

#### For example:
Suppose the base url is `https://store.com/forgot-password-confirm`,
then `storecraft` default email template will use this to send
a link with `https://store.com/forgot-password-confirm?token={{CONFIRM_TOKEN}}`

You can use this to delegate into `storecraft` auth backend endpoint
`/api/auth/forgot-password-request-confirm?token={{CONFIRM_TOKEN}}`

**@default** `platform.env.SC_GENERAL_STORE_FORGOT_PASSWORD_CONFIRM_BASE_URL` environment
