# Notifications

`storecraft` **API** lets you manage a `notifications` resource. this is
key in the **Dashboard** app, where you can view latest notifications.

Notifications enable you to
- Create the notifications in the style you like.
- Create the notifications with the content you want.
- Define actions to react to notifications in the Dashboard.

## How It Works

```ts
import { App } = '@storecraft/core'
import type { CollectionType, AuthUserType } = '@storecraft/core/v-api'

const app = new App(
  new NodePlatform(),
  new MongoDB(),
  new GoogleStorage(),
).on(
  'collections/upsert',
  async (event) => {
    const previous: CollectionType = event.payload.previous;
    const current: CollectionType = event.payload.current;
  }
).on(
  'auth/signup',
  async (event) => {
    const user: Partial<AuthUserType> = event.payload;

    // Here you can send an onboarding email for example

    console.log(user.email);
  }
).on(
  'checkout/complete',
  async (event) => {
    const order_data: OrderData = event.payload;

    // Here send an email with order details to customer
  }
);

```
