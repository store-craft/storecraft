# Notifications

**Storecraft** **API** lets you manage a `notifications` resource. this is
key in the **Dashboard** app, where you can view latest notifications.

Notifications enable you to
- Create the notifications in the style you like.
- Create the notifications with the content you want.
- Define actions to react to notifications in the Dashboard.

## Quick Example

```ts
import { App } from '@storecraft/core'
import type { CustomerType } from '@storecraft/core/v-api'

const app = new App(
  new NodePlatform(),
  new MongoDB(),
  new GoogleStorage(),
).on(
  'customers/upsert',
  async (event) => {
    const isNew = !Boolean(event.payload.previous);
    const customer: Partial<CustomerType> = event.payload;

    if(!isNew)  
      return;

    // here, you can send an onboarding personal template

    await event.app.api.notifications.addBulk(
      [
        {
          message: `
            ðŸš€ **${customer.firstname ?? 'New user'}** Just signed up\n 
            > Email is \`${customer.email}\`.
          `,
          search: ['signup', 'new-user'],
          author: 'backend-bot ðŸ¤–',
          actions: [
            {
              name: 'goto',
              type: 'route',
              params: {
                collection: 'customers',
                document: customer.id,
              }
            }
          ]
        },
      ]
    );

  }
)

```

## How It Works

Each notification is made up of
- `message` content can be in **Markdown** Format.
- Search terms for future search.
- `author` indicating who wrote the notification.
- `actions`, which is an array of **actions**, currently supports
  - internal `routing` for **Dashboard**
  - Follow a **URL**
  - (coming in the future) invoke an **HTTP** request.
