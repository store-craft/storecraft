# Platforms

**Storecraft** abstracts the platform on which it runs. This is achieved
by custom platform modules, that currently translate the networking requests.

## How It Works

### The Network Flow
Under the hood, each platform plugin can adapt `http` requests and
translate them into modern Web `Request` and `Response` objects.


For example, in `Node.js`
- `http.IncomingMessage` is translated into Web [`Request`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request)
- `storecraft` computes a Web [`Response`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response) from the previous Web [`Request`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request)
- The previous Web [`Response`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response) is translated into native `http.ServerResponse`.

### The `handler` method

Then, a `handler` method in the `storecraft` **App** class receives **native**
request and response and adapts it with the platform module.

For example, in **Node.js**
```js
import 'dotenv/config';
import http from "node:http";
import { join } from "node:path";
import { homedir } from "node:os";

import { App } from '@storecraft/core'
import { NodePlatform } from '@storecraft/platforms/node';
import { MongoDB } from '@storecraft/database-mongodb-node'
import { NodeLocalStorage } from '@storecraft/storage-local/node'

let app = new App(
  new NodePlatform(),
  new MongoDB(),
  new NodeLocalStorage(join(homedir(), 'tomer'))
);

await app.init();

```

Then, a server is started. Pay attention `app.handler`

```js
// app.handler receives 
// (http.IncomingMessage, http.ServerResponse) native
// object
const server = http.createServer(app.handler).listen(
  8000,
  () => {
    console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:8000`);
  }
);
```

With this common technique, the underlying `platform` is abstracted away
from `storecraft`

## Officialy Supported Platforms

Currently,

- `Node.js >= 18` platform through `@storecraft/platforms`
- `AWS Api Gateway` (coming soon)
- `Google Functions` (coming soon, but should be covered by the `@storecraft/platforms`)
- `Cloudflare Workers` (coming soon)
