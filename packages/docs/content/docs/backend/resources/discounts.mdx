# Discounts

First, learn about discounts concepts at the [Dashboard](admin/discounts) documentation.

**Storecraft** is commerce-as-code platform, so you can do everything with code.

First, make sure you have a running app.

```js
import { App } from '@storecraft/core';
import { MongoDB } from '@storecraft/database-mongodb';
import { NodePlatform } from '@storecraft/core/platform/node';
import { R2 } from '@storecraft/storage-s3-compatible'

const app = new App(config)
  .withPlatform(new NodePlatform())
  .withDatabase(new MongoDB())
  .withStorage(new R2());

await app.init();

```

## Discount Types

Storecraft supports 5 types of automatic and manual (coupons) discounts
with product and order filter:

- **Regular Discounts**
- **Bulk Discounts**
- **Buy X Get Y Discounts**
- **Bundle Discounts**
- **Order Discounts**

## Discount Application Type

There are two types of discount applications:
- **Automatic** discounts, applied automatically at checkout
- **Manual (Coupons)** discounts, applied manually using a code 

## Discount Filters

So, every discount has an array of filters at `filters` property.
There are two types of filters, product and order filters.

### Product Filters

We support,
- **All products** filter, which means all products are eligible for the filter
- **Product In Collections**, which qualifies products, that belong to any of the collections in the value array
- **Product NOT In Collections**, which qualifies products, that belong to neither of the collections in the value array
- **Product In Tags**, which qualifies products, that have any tags in the value array
- **Product NOT In Tags**, which qualifies products, that dont have any tags in the value array
- **Product In Products**, which qualifies products, that have the same `id` and `handle` as in the value array
- **Product NOT In Products**, which qualifies products, that dont have the same `id` and `handle` as in the value array
- **Product In Price Range**, which qualifies products, have their price in the range specified at `value` object

### Order Filters

We support,
- **Order Has Customers** filter, which qualifies orders, that were ordered by specific customers by ids
- **Order Date In Range** filter, which qualifies orders, that were ordered at specific time frames.

## Upsert Regular Discount

In this example, `10% OFF` of products, that have the `regular` tag attached

  active: true, 
  handle: 'discount-10-off-regular', 
  title: '10% OFF Regular tags',
  priority: 0, 
  application: enums.DiscountApplicationEnum.Auto, 
  info: {
    details: {
      type: 'regular',
      extra: {
        fixed: 0, percent: 10
      }
    },
    filters: [
      { 
        op: 'p-in-tags',
        value: ['regular']
