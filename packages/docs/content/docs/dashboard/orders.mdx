# Creating Orders

Creating a manual Order (or automatically at backend upon checkout) is very easy with `storecraft`.

But before all that that jazz, let's dive into understanding the parts of an <Pink c='order'/> 

## Line Items

Perhaps the first thing to come in mind are the <Purple c='line items' />.

But what exactly are they ? merely a list of the goods the customer puts in the cart for buying.

Each [LineItem](schema/definitions#LineItem) is made up of 
1. The `product` identifier (or `variant` in some systems)
2. The `quantity` of this product

And that's about it. 

Now, imagine a list of these items. This list is simply called `line items`.

With `storecraft` you can easily add line items.

When managing line items, you can control various aspects including 
> Reducing the stock quantity in favor for the order

## Pricing

Given that we have,
1. **Line items**
2. **Automatic Discounts**
3. Optional **Manual Discounts** (Coupons)
4. A Customer **Contact information** (may be anonymous)
4. Selected **Shipping Method**

Now, we can compute the **pricing** of the order.

But, how is it done exactly ?

First, Automatic Discounts are stacked according to their order (priority),
on top of them we stack the manual discounts (coupons).

Then, we run the pricing engine, which tries to invoke each discount leading
to a list of [Pricing Evolution](schema/definitions#EvoEntry) object, which explains at
each stage, how a discount transformed the <Lime c='line items' />.

The total is then calculated:

**Total** = (`sub-total undiscounted`) - (`sub-total discounted`) + (`shipping`)


## Payments

Payment Gateways are customizable in `storecraft`. Each `order` page has a <Lime c='payment'/> card.

Uou can learn about payment gateways API [here](/backend/checkout-and-payments/checkouts)

`storecraft` officialy supports and maintains some well known payment gateways, but, you
are encouraged to write your own optimal payment integration solutions.
