# Creating Storefronts
So,  what exactly is a store front ?

A **storefront** as the name suggest holds the data required
to make decisions of **what** to show to your users when they are
entering the front page of your store.

It should hold things like:
- Active automatic discounts, that you offer
- Special products, that you want to highlight in a carousel for example
- Which product collections you want to expose your customers to.
- Special announcements you want to your user to know about
- Any other configuration, that you want to control from your admin side

At `shelf`, this is one of the most essential data containers.

The best thing is, you can configure multiple storefronts for your users.
For example,
- Create a storefront for regular users
- Create a storefront for users coming from Europe
- Create a storefront for users a specific user, fully customizable

> And this is a key point. Store fronts can be **customized**

As with [collections](admin/collections), we offer a way to **publish**
a compressed `json` of your storefront, which can be easily cached at the user's
browser or at your backend.
