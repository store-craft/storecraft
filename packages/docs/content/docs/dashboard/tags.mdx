# Tags & Attributes

`Tags` and `Attributes` pay an important role for customizing the behaviour
of your data. Both are <Lime c='key values'/> data containers, that can be attached to
almost any other data.

Both are similar but have differences and are better suited for different use cases

## Tags

A `Tag` is essentialy
* A Name (key)
* A list of values

For example, suppose you sell <Lime c='shirts'/>, then you might define the following Tag

<Image src='/docs/main/admin-tags-1.webp' className='w-3/4 sm:w-[500px] mx-auto  mt-5' />

This `tag` defines a tag with name `filter:size` and possible values of
* `small` `medium` `large` `x-large` `2x-large`

> A tag name and values cannot have white spaces !

Each of the values create a tag **specialization**, such as:
* <Purple c='filter:size_small'/>
* <Purple c='filter:size_large'/>
* <Purple c='filter:size_x-large'/>
* <Purple c='filter:size_2x-large'/>

Each of these **specialization** can be attached to any data container in `storecraft`.

> These `tags` specials are also added to the search index array

For example, a tag special can be attached to a product via the `tags` card in
product page.

<Image src='/docs/main/admin-tags-2.webp' className='w-3/4 sm:w-[300px] mx-auto  mt-5' />

> These `tags` specials are attached to `tags` property in the [product](schema/definitions#ProductData) container

### Use cases of `Tags`

There are many use cases, let's mention some of the most popular cases

#### Client Side Products Filtering

> Consult `storecraft` client side library for filtering

#### Tagging A Customer
Sometimes, you want to characterize your users based on their interests.

For example, you have a user that has bought more than 10 shirts, then you
might want to tag him with `interests_shirts`.

So, in the future, when you have a special offer, you can fetch all users who like to buy many shirts.

## Attributes
<Lime c='Attributes' /> are kinda similar to `tags` in the sense they both are tools
for attaching textual key-values into other data containers.

But, attributes have the following capabilities
* Can hold any text (as opposed to tags that hold words without white space and punctuations).
* Attribute key can appear as many times you want, therefore allowing you to address it as a group

You can use them to hold 
* Messages with emojis
* Serialized `json`
* etc...

Following, an example of `attributes` used in a [storefront](/dashboard/storefronts) to attach some quick messages.

<Image src='/docs/main/admin-tags-3.webp' className='w-3/4 sm:w-[300px] mx-auto  mt-5' />

Under the hood [Attribute](schema/definitions#AttributeData) is just a key-value storage.

When you attach it to other data containers, it becomes a list

```json
'attributes': [
  {
    'key': 'marquee',
    'val': 'ðŸš€  We offer FREE SHIPPING'
  },
  {
    'key': 'marquee',
    'val': 'ðŸš€  We got new products TODAY'
  },
]

```
