# Product Variants

Product variants is a staple feature, that every merchant should know about and use.

But, what are they exactly ?

So, let's suppose you are selling a branded t-shirt ðŸ‘• and let's suppose that the shirt
- has many sizes `small` / `medium` / `large`
- and the shirt has two colors `red` / `white`

You may start to feel, that products are usually manufactured with different flavours
in order to appeal to a wider consumer markets and rightfully so.

<table className='border mx-auto mt-5'>
  <tbody className='border'>
    <tr className='border'>
      <td children='' className='border'/>
      <td children=' small ' className='border px-3'/>
      <td children=' medium ' className='border px-3'/>
      <td children=' large ' className='border px-3'/>
    </tr>
    <tr className='border' className='border'>
      <td children=' red ' className='border px-3'/>
      <td children='âœ…' className='border text-center'/>
      <td children='âœ…' className='border text-center'/>
      <td children='âœ…' className='border text-center'/>
    </tr>
    <tr className='border' className='border'>
      <td children=' white ' className='border px-3'/>
      <td children='âœ…' className='border text-center'/>
      <td children='âœ…' className='border text-center'/>
      <td children='âœ…' className='border text-center'/>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Let's iterate all the possible **6** <Purple c='variants'/>:
- a `small`, `red` shirt 
- a `small`, `white` shirt 
- a `medium`, `red` shirt 
- a `medium`, `white` shirt 
- a `large`, `red` shirt 
- a `large`, `white` shirt 

> Yep, Each **variant** is a **combination**

**Storecraft** supports product variants.
With `storecraft`, we have a main product and each variant is a child product with it's own handle
and specific data such as images, description, stock and pricing.

Let's see an example and a developer guide

## Guide
First, let's edit or create a new product

<div className='flex flex-row flex-wrap --bg-red-400 gap-5 mt-10'>
  {
    [
      { url: 'admin-variants-0.webp', label: 'Scroll to the Product Variants card' },
      { url: 'admin-variants-1.webp', label: 'Hit the + button and add product Options with values' },
      { url: 'admin-variants-2.webp', label: 'Below them, variants will show' },
    ].map(
      (it, ix) => (
        <Image key={ix} 
               src={`/docs/main/${it.url}`} className='w-full sm:w-[500px]' 
               label={`${++ix}. ${it.label}`}/>
      )
    )
  }
</div>

Let's create one of the variants. 
- Click on the `create` button next to **Large** / **White** variant.
- A new product page will show with somw filled data (based on the parent product)
- Fill up it's pricing, description and stock
- click `create`
- go back to the main product

Now, you will see the green check mark next to it
<Image src={`/docs/main/admin-variants-3.webp`} className='w-full sm:w-[500px]' 
        label={`green check mark`}/>

> Don't forget to **save**        

## Developer guide
First of all, each `variant` in the database is a product on it's own right.
This helps with unified `checkout` and `search` functions.

> ðŸ’¡ Reminder, each **variant** is a child product of the main product

Every variant product is **ALSO** embedded in the parent product through the
`variants_products` property found in [ProductData](schema/definitions#ProductData),
this helps when loading the parent product, then all of it's children products are just there.

Each option with it's **id** and values (and **ids**) are recorded in the parent product's
`product_options` field.

Each handle in [variants_products](schema/definitions#ProductData) maps into 
[VariantCombination](schema/definitions#VariantCombination) which tells exactly
the option ids and selection ids that trigger this variant product  .

Here is a sample `json` that explains these relations

<Image src={`/docs/main/admin-variants-4.webp`} className='w-full sm:w-[500px]' 
        label={`green check mark`}/>

> ðŸ’¡ If a product has a `parent_handle` property, then it is a **variant** of the **parent** product, you can also watch the `_product_hint` property, which tells which options seclections it triggers
