# Tags & Attributes
`Tags` and `Attributes` pay an important role for customizing the behaviour
of your data. Both are <Lime c='key values'/> data containers, that can be attached to
almost any other data.

Both are similar but have differences and are better suited for different use cases

## Tags

A `Tag` definition is essentialy
* A Name (key)
* A list of values

For example, suppose you sell <Lime c='shirts'/>, then you might define the following Tag
<Image src='/docs/main/admin-tags-1.webp' className='w-3/4 sm:w-[500px] mx-auto  mt-5' />

This `tag` defines a tag with name `filter:size` and possible values of
* `small` `medium` `large` `x-large` `2x-large`

> A tag name and values cannot have white spaces !

Each of the values create a tag **specialization**, such as:
* <Purple c='filter:size_small'/>
* <Purple c='filter:size_large'/>
* <Purple c='filter:size_x-large'/>
* <Purple c='filter:size_2x-large'/>

Each of these **specialization** can be attached to any data container in `shelf`.

> These `tags` specials are also added to the search index array


For example, a tag special can be attached to a product via the `tags` card in
product page 

<Image src='/docs/main/admin-tags-2.webp' className='w-3/4 sm:w-[300px] mx-auto  mt-5' />

> These `tags` specials are attached to `tags` property in the [product](schema/definitions#ProductData) container

### Use cases of `Tags`
There are many use cases, let's mention some of the most popular cases

#### Client side products filtering
> Consult `shelf` client side library for filtering

#### Tagging a user
Sometimes, you want to characterize your users based on their interests.
For example, you have a user that has bought more than 10 shirts, then you
might want to tag him with `interests_shirts`, so in the future, when you have 
a special offer, you can fetch all users who like to buy many shirts


## Attributes
<Lime c='Attributes' /> are kinda similar to `tags` in the sense they both are tools
for attaching textual key-values into other data containers.

But, attributes  have the following capabilities:
* can hold any text (as opposed to tags that hold words without white space).
* Attribute key can appear as many times you want, therefore allowing you to address it as a group

You can use them to hold 
* messages with emojis
* serialized `json`

Here, is an example of `attributes` used in a storefront to attach some quick messages
<Image src='/docs/main/admin-tags-3.webp' className='w-3/4 sm:w-[300px] mx-auto  mt-5' />

Under the hood [Attribute](schema/definitions#AttributeData) is just a key-value storage.
When you attach it to other data containers, it becomes a list

```json
'attributes': [
  {
    'key': 'marquee',
    'val': 'ðŸš€  We offer FREE SHIPPING'
  },
  {
    'key': 'marquee',
    'val': 'ðŸš€  We got new products TODAY'
  },
]

```
