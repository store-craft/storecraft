# Events

As the `shelf-backend` is built with Google Firebase functions, we can
use event handlers for **Firestore** events:
- `onDocumentCreated` event - Event handler which triggers when a document is created in Firestore
- `onDocumentWritten` event - Event handler which triggers when a document is created, updated, or deleted in Firestore
- `onDocumentUpdated` event - Event handler which triggers when a document is updated in Firestore
- `onDocumentDeleted` event - Event handler which triggers when a document is deleted in Firestore

We use these events to generate and send emails to users when

#### `Order` checkout transitions into `complete` status
Send SMTP Email about order creation.

#### `Order` fulfillment transitions into `shipped` status
Send SMTP Email about order shipping update.

#### `Order` fulfillment transitions into `cancelled` status
Send SMTP Email about order cancellation.

#### `User` is created
Send SMTP Email welcoming the `user`
