# Introduction

There are a few reasons why we created this platform, let's discuss it

### Scalability
All of **Firebase's** products are scalable, infinitely or so scalable. As opposed, to
the old paradigm were one would have to rent a single server, install a database on it
and cross his fingers, that traffic will not overwhelm the server and the database.

So, amazingly enough, we are in the era of scalability, a thing that is hard to achieve with classic
WordPress sites.

### Cost
You really cannot get something better. Firebase has an amazing free tier and a pay as you
go (usage based) price one you surpass it. `shelf` was born to take advantage of this cost
effectiveness.

You can operate a small store without ever surpassing the free tier of firebase.

### Headless
Headless Commerce systems are the present and future. By decoupling the presentation
layer, i.e front-end from your business logic, you enable a lot of things:
* `Scalability` - No longer does your backend system determines the vast performance of your frontend
* `Originality` - No more do you have to deal with pre-made templates. Now you can craft your own original websites and
unique experiences to delight your customers.
* `Omnichannels` - Your backend can serve both mobile, web, desktop and IoT users


### Customizable
You can customize and craft your own commerce behaviours at the backend. `shelf` is aware
to some parts of your backend (should you choose to use one).

### Speed
A lot of commerce systems have the notion of a payment gateway, for example, where they
try to capture all possible features of some payment API such as `stripe`. 
In reality, users only need to use one branch of these features, costing them in speed and bugs.
We provide you a solid backbone, that you can take shape the features you need.
Our `PayPal` integration is just a single file, easy to understand and change for your own needs,
if changes are needed.

We do not maintain a plugin with 1000 issues at github covering all possible payment scenarios,
it is an overkill. We instead, use minimalism as a guide to use only what we require.

### Versatility
* You can use `shelf` to run your offline business, just to manage your inventory, customers and orders.
* You can get started in minutes with `shelf`

### Toolings
The `shelf` platform comes with some delights to make it easy to use at client and backend side.
* `shelf-client-js-sdk` - a very simple client side js sdk, that talks to firebase with it's lightweight
REST API. It takes care of authentication, public resources like products, collections, storefronts etc..
* `shelf-client-react-hooks` - a React hook lib for shelf
* `shelf-backend` - a base backend for shelf example. Easy to customize (only 160kb)
