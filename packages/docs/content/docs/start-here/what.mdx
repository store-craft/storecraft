# Introduction

`shelf` turns your firebase resources into a `headless commerce platform`.
shelf is a **CMS** (Content Management System) essentially. Out of the box, it does
this while utilizing the following resources, that are available to you

## Firestore Database
Firestore is the leading no-SQL database offering by Google. Some of it's benefits
- Very generous free tier
- pay as you go pricing above the free tier
- Infinitely scalable as opposed to other common databases

`shelf` manages your firestore to create the a fully functional commerce platform.
It does so by managing the following collections:

* `/products` collection to store product information
* `/collections` collection to store collections information
* `/storefronts` collection to manage storefront data
* `/tags` collection to manage laconic key value tags (helpful for filtering)
* `/users` collection to manage users
* `/discounts` collection to manage automatic and manual(coupons) discounts
* `/orders` collection to manage orders with states and line items
* `/shipping_methods` collection to manage shipping methods
* `/images` collection to manage images
* `/payment_gateways` collection to manage configurations of payment gateways
* `/posts` collection to manage rich media
* `/notifications` collection to manage admin notifications
* `/settings` collection to manage admin notifications

Once, `shelf` manages these collections for your project, you can use them in your app
however you want at client side and backend side. But, we made things simpler for you,
we developed an optional client side **SDK** and a sample backend to enable payments and
checkouts from a website as well as emails.

## Storage
Object Storage is a classic serverless object storage, where you can store images, files, jsons
and any type of blob you can think of. `shelf` leverages storage services
1. To store images you upload and edit in the products page
2. Save compressed exported collections with embedded products
3. Save compressed exported storefronts

We support the following object storage services
### Cloudflare R2 storage
yes, we support it
### Amazon S3
yes, we support it
### Any S3 compatible service
such as minIO
### Firebase Google Storage
Of course, we also support Google storage

## Firebase Authentication (identity)
`shelf` uses firebase authorization to distinguish you as part of the admin users, that's it.

## Firebase Functions
firebase functions is Google's leading serverless functions offering. `shelf` does not
require functions, but we recommend using them for the following use cases:

* Integrating payment **API** such as `PayPal standard checkout` or `stripe` at your website
* Sending Emails for events when a user onboards or when an order was confirmed or shipped.

Luckily, we have open sourced our very small and effective backend, that you can deploy in few
clicks, and the best part, you can customize it to your own needs.
