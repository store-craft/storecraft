# Why Use **Storecraft**

There are a few reasons why we created this platform, let's discuss it

## Scale To The Moon

**Storecraft** is written in pure Javascript, has it's own internal
virtual HTTP router around standard Web [Request](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request) and [Response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response).

The **Platform** part of **Storecraft** is modular therefore.

Wether you want to go Serverless and scale to the moon or go Serverfull but
not scalable with Node.js, you can achieve it ! ðŸ’ª

You can craft everything to be scalable with
