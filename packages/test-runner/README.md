A work in progress package to test:
- api and databases integrations
- and more

```bash
npm i @storecraft/test-runner
```

## v-api controller test
Everything prefixed with `api.` tests files within `v-api` folder
of `StoreCraft`. This is just testing the controller and the database.

## storage integration
storage is tested in it's own package, but integration test should be made available here

## v-rest controller
In the future, I will combine rest controller testing with `v-api`
